OPERATORS

    -operators act on our data
    -classified by what they do and how many operands(values that operators act on) they require
        unary: one operand
            ! : BANG operator, or NOT, reverses true/false values
            - : negation, unary arithmetic operator, reverses positive/negative
            typeof : returns type of value
        binary: two operands
        ternary: three operands
            conditional (ternary) operator is only operator with three operands:
                 a condition followed by a question mark (?)
                then an expression to execute if the condition is truth-y followed by a colon (:)
                the expression to execute if the condition is false-y
             (condition ? expIfTrue : expIfFalse)


Assignment operators
    =, +=, -=, /=, *=
    permanent changes
    (a += 2) is same as (a = a + 2)
    
Arithmetic operators
    =, -, *, /, %(returns remainder of division operation)

Comparison operators
    >, <, >=, <=, ===, !==
    used in conditionals, compares two values and resolve to a boolean value, true or false

Logical operators
    &&: AND operator, used inbetween two conditionals, and only evaluates to true if BOTH resolve to true
    ||: OR operator, used inbetween two conditionals, and evaluates to true if one or the other resolve to true
